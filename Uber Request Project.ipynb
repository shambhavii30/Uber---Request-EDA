The dataset contains information such as request ID, pickup point, driver ID, trip status, request date and time, and drop date and time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis was carried out using Excel, SQL, and Python (Pandas & NumPy) to cover the complete data analysis lifecycle. Initially, the raw data was cleaned using Excel, where missing values were handled, date and time fields were separated, time slots were created, and new features such as request hour, drop hour, and trip duration were derived. Pivot tables and dashboards were also created in Excel to visualize key trends and patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, SQL queries were used to extract meaningful insights from the data. These queries helped in identifying total requests, status-wise distribution of trips, pickup point analysis (Airport vs City), peak demand hours, and time periods with maximum “No Cars Available” issues. SQL made it easier to perform aggregation and grouping operations to support data-driven conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Further, Python (Pandas) was used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to validate findings and understand data distribution. Using Python, missing values were analyzed, categorical distributions were examined, and summary statistics were generated to support the insights obtained from Excel and SQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis revealed that a significant number of ride failures were due to No Cars Available, especially during morning and evening peak hours. Airport pickup points showed higher supply-demand gaps compared to city pickups. Additionally, completed airport trips generally had longer durations than city trips.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project demonstrates how combining Excel for data cleaning and visualization, SQL for querying insights, and Python for EDA can provide a comprehensive understanding of real-world operational data. The insights from this analysis can help in improving driver allocation strategies and reducing supply shortages during peak demand periods."
